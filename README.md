# ML/DL mini projects

In this repository, I engage in simple experimentations and tests with various ML/DL models across different datasets. The goal is to explore the capabilities and performance of these models in diverse scenarios. And interested in applying/doing/making in ML/Data Engineering, Data Science and/or GenAI.

## Full Process Overview

The full process for ML/DL projects typically involves several stages, including loading and analyzing data, preprocessing, normalization and standardization, pre-training, training, post-training, and evaluation.

1. **Loading Data**: The first step is to load the dataset into memory. This can be done using various libraries and file formats depending on the data source.

2. **Analyzing Data**: Once the data is loaded, it's important to analyze its structure, distribution, and any patterns or anomalies present. This helps in understanding the data and making informed decisions during preprocessing.

3. **Preprocessing**: Preprocessing involves cleaning and transforming the data to make it suitable for training. This may include handling missing values, removing outliers, and encoding categorical variables.

4. **Normalization and Standardization**: Normalization and standardization are techniques used to scale the data to a common range. Normalization typically scales the data to a range of 0 to 1, while standardization transforms the data to have zero mean and unit variance.

5. **Pre-training**: In some cases, pre-training is performed to initialize the model with weights learned from a similar task or dataset. This can help in improving the model's performance and convergence during training.

6. **Training**: The training stage involves feeding the preprocessed data to the ML/DL model and optimizing its parameters using an appropriate algorithm (e.g., gradient descent). The goal is to minimize the model's loss function and improve its predictive performance.

7. **Post-training**: After the model is trained, it's important to evaluate its performance on unseen data. This may involve performing additional preprocessing steps on the evaluation data and applying the trained model to make predictions.

8. **Evaluation**: The final stage is to evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score. This helps in assessing the model's effectiveness and identifying areas for improvement.

By following this full process, you can gain insights into the capabilities and performance of ML/DL models across different datasets.
